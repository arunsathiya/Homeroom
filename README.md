Some notes for early experimenters:

- The front-end editor thing doesn't work
- The template hierarchy is kind of (maybe unnecessarily) complex
- Everything's experimental for now
- I've just been hacking away at this for personal use, so there's been no real consideration towards performance, scalability, or anything else like that. Just playing.
- Pull requests welcome
- Long ago diverged from _s unfortunately. At some point I'll try to look at changes and merge them in.
