This is the first publicly-released WordPress theme I've ever built, despite having worked with WP in some capacity for almost 8 years now. I don't consider myself a designer, nor do I consider myself particularly creative in a design sense. Thus the relatively minimal appearance of Homeroom. Regardless, I could never have built this theme without a lot of help (whether specific people knew it or not). Here are some resources/people I'd like to thank specifically:

* [_s](http://underscores.me/) -- this is the starter theme that Homeroom is based on. It allowed me to skip a LOT of ground work.
* [The WordPress.com Themes Team](http://themeshaper.com/) -- for lots of tips, tricks, gotchas, best practices. Just being around these folks means you learn a lot about building amazing themes. I'm lucky enough to work with them at Automattic and thus learn a lot from them through osmosis.
* [icoMoon](http://icomoon.io/) -- brilliant icons/glyphs, built into a webfont for use in Homeroom. The full font, as exported from icoMoon (so you can upload/customize it if you like) is available in the homeroom-font/ directory within this theme
* [Instapaper](http://instapaper.com/), [Readability](http://readability.com/) and [Pocket](http://getpocket.com/) -- inspiration for the visual styling of the theme, which I wanted to be minimalist, and super-readable.
* Tommi Kaikkonen for his [Interactive Guide to Blog Typography](http://kaikkonendesign.fi/typography/)
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com) for allowing me to do things with JS which I would otherwise not bother figuring out :)
* [Masonry](http://masonry.desandro.com/) for taking the above statement one step further and providing a really slick layout engine (used on archives/search result pages)
* Google, for making their [maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/) really powerful and accessible
* [This post](http://www.1stwebdesigner.com/tutorials/create-stay-on-top-menu-css3-jquery/) for some details on getting the floating menu working
* Me (hah!) and the rest of Automattic for [Jetpack](http://jetpack.me), which is heavily integrated with this theme and provides a number of features (e.g. infinite scroll, enhanced commenting)
* [The P2 Theme](http://p2theme.com) for the inspiration for the front-end editor in Homeroom
